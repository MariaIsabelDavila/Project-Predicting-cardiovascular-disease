### Introduction: An unbalanced dataset was given to students. This contained a series of predictor variables (18) that will later influence on the prediction of a heart disease (the response variable). However, the dataset in addition of being unbalanced, had null and wrong values in the predictor variables. All the information was provided by public and private health institutions. Our objective, as a team was to process all the information in order to have a clean dataset and make further correct predictions with the best machine learning algorithm
### The file will have a dataframe of more than 300 thousand records, with several predictor variables and a binary response variable. The file will include the cleaning of the dataframe, the data balance and the running of different prediction models.
